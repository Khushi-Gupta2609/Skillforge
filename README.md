## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

To get SkillForge up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or Yarn
- Firebase account
- Google AI Studio account

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdalazizesam/skillforge.git
cd skillforge
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Firebase & Gemini Configuration

SkillForge uses Firebase for user authentication and data storage, and Google Gemini for AI capabilities. You'll need to set up your own Firebase project and obtain a Gemini API key.

#### Create a Firebase Project:

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Add a web app to your project
4. Enable Firebase Authentication (Email/Password and Google Sign-In providers)
5. Enable Realtime Database (start in test mode for quick setup, then secure your rules)
6. Copy your Firebase configuration object

#### Obtain a Google Gemini API Key:

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create an API Key

#### Create a .env.local file:

In the root of your project, create a file named `.env.local` and add your Firebase and Gemini API keys:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY"
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN"
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID"
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET"
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID"
VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL="YOUR_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL"
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual keys and URLs. Ensure `VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL` is correctly set for the Realtime Database.

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server, usually on `http://localhost:5173`. Open your browser and navigate to this URL.
